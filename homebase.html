                    <h2>The Homebase Illusion</h2>
                <p> 
                    The year is 2003. Roy Savage blasts down the a12 in his racing green Range Rover Aoshima. 
                    He checks his watch- 19:40- only 20 minutes till the Chelmsford Homebase closes, and with 
                    it, any hope of securing a pot of Dulux Cherry Red. His grip tightens round the 
                    premium-leather wheel. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    He was supposed to leave work at the usual 5, but got caught up at 
                    the desk telling a young receptionist about the aforementioned Aoshima’s horsepower. 
                    Roadworks had then caused a further gruelling 2 hour delay. Roy winces at the thought of 
                    the traffic jam he was just enveloped in; how it could have been avoided if he’d saved the 
                    chit chat. But in honesty she did seem genuinely interested, which soothes Roy’s red-hot 
                    mind temporarily, along with the lukewarm peach ice-tea his son has left in the car.  
                </p>
                <p> As the beastly cruiser kicks up a gear, careering off the motorway and into the curve of the 
                    Springfield roundabout set, visions of his wife swirl into focus. And boy is she pissed. 
                    Without this precious cherry the long overdue downstairs bathroom repaint will not get done 
                    till next week. Driven by sheer adrenaline and haunted by the angry ghost of his wife 
                    (not dead), Roy screeches round the parkway-moulsham street turn-off, narrowly avoiding one 
                    of his son’s friends. No time to think of something to shout, he just blasts the horn and 
                    maintains a solemn middle finger out the window at the rapidly diminishing figure. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    With only a frantic 10 minutes on the clock, Roy turns into the Homebase car park with the speed and 
                    race of Jason Statham, minus the bare dome. The full-headed (and proud!) dad speed-walks to 
                    the big green sliding doors. Once inside, a shop assistant signals to him to be quick- no 
                    problem buddy, I’m just after one thing. Another few glugs to finish off the ice tea and Roy 
                    makes a sharp turn into the paint isle. A sea of colour envelops him. The majesty of the Dulux 
                    full range- from Jasmine Shimmer to Intense Chestnut- stretch as far as the eye can see. They 
                    swirl and dance in front of Roy, their subtle tints dazzle and beguile the father of two. It 
                    becomes too much. He falls to the ground. The floor is oddly soft, even inviting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a full 45 minutes before the entity formerly known as Roy Savage realises that he is still lying down. 
                    The lights are off. Homebase is closed. The core components of the 5 dissolved Big Bertha acid 
                    tab present in his son’s peach ice tea have started to take hold of Roy’s neural sensors. 
                    Sheepishly, he gets to his feet and dusts off his cargos. He stares into the endless darkness 
                    of the gargantuan shop-floor. The experience that unravels from this moment cannot be explained 
                    verbally. It is only through an auditory performance via key eye-witnesses that we can comprehend 
                    his enlightenment.
